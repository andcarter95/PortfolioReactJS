                <p>
                    I'm an ambitious and motivated software developer looking for an
                    opportunity to work on challenging projects for an established company.

                <p>
                    I have spent the last year learning the skills required to be a
                    successful full stack developer at Kansas State University. Learning various 
                    languages and platforms such as: HTML, CSS, React, JavaScript, PostgresSQL, 
                    MongoDB, and Python. While spending my time outside of class taking courses 
                    on Udemy in React and JavaScript.
